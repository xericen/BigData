"""Week 3 · Task 3 — Find the same pairs without comparing everything.

Textbook §3.4.

`BruteForce` compares every pair. On 3,000 documents that is 4.5 million
comparisons and it is completely correct. On 3 million documents it is 4.5
trillion and it is completely useless.

Beat it. Find the same near-duplicate pairs while making far fewer comparisons.

    python3 bench.py
    python3 bench.py --yours

The harness counts every call you make to `similarity()`. That is your score.
It also checks **recall** - which of the truly similar pairs you found. Skipping
comparisons is easy; skipping comparisons without losing the pairs is the task.

    `similarity(a, b)` is the only way to compare two documents, and every call
    is counted. Everything else - signatures, banding, bucketing - is free, in
    the sense that the harness does not charge you for it. That is deliberate:
    it is also roughly true at scale, where the comparison is the expensive
    part and the hashing is linear.

    Two knobs decide everything:

        the number of hashes in a signature
        how many bands you split it into

    §3.4.2 gives you the relationship between those and the probability that a
    pair at similarity s becomes a candidate. It is an S-curve, and where its
    step sits is something you choose. Choose it on purpose and be able to say
    why in observation.md - a threshold of 0.8 does not mean bands should be
    anything in particular until you have done the arithmetic.

    You may reuse your Task 1 code.
