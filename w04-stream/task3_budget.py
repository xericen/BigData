"""Week 4 · Task 3 — Same memory, fewer mistakes.

Textbook §4.4 (Bloom filters), §4.5 (counting distinct).

`NaiveFilter` is a membership filter in a fixed number of bits. It works. It
also makes far more mistakes than it has to with the memory it was given, and
it does so for a reason you can find by reading §4.4.2 and doing one derivative.

You get **exactly the same number of bits**. Make fewer mistakes.

    python3 bench.py
    python3 bench.py --yours

The rule that makes this interesting: a false negative is not allowed. Ever.
The whole point of this structure is that "no" means no. A filter that gets a
better score by occasionally forgetting something it was given has not improved
anything, it has broken the contract.

    `memory_bits()` must not exceed the `n_bits` you were given. The harness
    checks. Counting only some of your memory is not an optimisation.

    §4.4.2 gives the false-positive rate of a filter with m bits, k hashes and
    n items inserted. There is a k that minimises it, and it depends on m/n.
    The harness tells you n before you start, so you have no excuse for guessing.

    Then there is a second question, which is worth more: the harness inserts
    a **known** number of items, but a real stream does not tell you n in
    advance. What would you do then? You do not have to implement it - but
    observation.md asks.
